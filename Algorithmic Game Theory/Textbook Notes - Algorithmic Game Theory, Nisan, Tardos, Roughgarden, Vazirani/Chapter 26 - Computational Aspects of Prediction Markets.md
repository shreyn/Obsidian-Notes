## 26.1 Introduction: What is a Prediction Market?
**Information Aggregation problem**:
- Suppose there is a person (aggregator) who wants to get a prediction about some uncertain variable.
- Some number of people (informants) each hold different and nonindependent sets of information about the outcome. 
- The goal is to design a mechanism that extracts relevant information from the informants, aggregates, and creates a collective forecast.
**Prediction Market**
- is one mechanism designed to solve the above problem
- The aggregator creates a financial security whose payoff is tied to the outcome of the variable
- The informants can trade the security however they want
- The trading price is a collective forecast for the expected value of the uncertain variable.
