## High-level Rationale
- MAIN CONTRIBUTORS:
	- EV vehicles are the future
	- AI training is massive
	- Both of these consume electricity like crazy. 
- Electricity is stored in batteries. Battery storage systems will grow. 
- We need some better intelligence for battery storage systems.
## Pipeline of battery storage system business field
1. Raw material extraction (mining)
2. Material processing (refining)
3. Battery component manufacturing (components of a cell)
4. Cell manufacturing (assembly of cells)
5. Battery pack assembly
6. System integrators 
7. Deployment and operations


## Notes
- important differentiator: edge computing
	- sending data to cloud is slow, lacks privacy (needing in military, etc)
	- doesnt require large training data for ML
	- federatted learning (later on)
- OEMs make firmware **in general!!!**
	- our software can learn the workings per device, then made recommendations, etc.
